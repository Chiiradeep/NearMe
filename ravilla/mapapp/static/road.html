        A telephone exchange is a central hub that connects phone calls by routing signals between users.
        It serves as the backbone of telecommunication, enabling seamless voice communication across distances.
        Early exchanges were manual, with operators connecting calls using switchboards.
        Today, modern digital exchanges handle millions of calls automatically with high speed and reliability.
